# `Database Notes by Me`


## **Database Part**


### **Show Databases**

-> show database;


### **Create Database**:

-> create database "name";

-> create database seu;


### **Retrive Database**:

-> USE 'DB_NAME';

// show all tables od the used DB

-> show tables;


### **Update Database**:

-> CAN'T RENAME DATABASE


### **Delete Database**:

-> drop database 'DB_NAME';

**_N:B:_** Tried to note with sequence of CRUD. 

Where **CRUD** = **C**reate **R**etrive **U**pdate **D**elete.

CRUD operations are used in different applications. 

Sometimes those application is called as CRUD application.


## **Database Table Part**


### **Create Table**:

-> Desc 'Table_NAME';

// show all tables od the used DB

-> Desc studentinfo


### **Update Table**:

-> ALTER TABLE `TableName` 

RENAME TO  `UpdatedTableName` ;

-> ALTER TABLE 'STUDENTINFO'

RENAME TO 'STD_INFO'


### **Delete Table**:

-> drop table "tablename";


## **Database Table Column**


### **Create Column(add column)**:

6) select distinct DEPT from STUDENT;

or,

6) select DEPT from STUDENT GROUP BY DEPT;


### **Date Select:**

14) select NAME from STUDENT where year(GRAD_DATE) = "2008" && CGPA > 3.70; 

15) select * from STUDENT where year(GRAD_DATE) != "2008" && year(GRAD_DATE) != "2007";


### **Like Varchar Select:**

16) select * from STUDENT where name like "s%";  //starts with s

-> select * from STUDENT where name like "s%a";//starts with s, ends with a

17) select * from STUDENT where NAME like "%a%a%"; // at least two 'a' in string


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>LIKE 'a%'
   </td>
   <td>Finds any values that start with "a"
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>LIKE '%a'
   </td>
   <td>Finds any values that end with "a"
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>LIKE '%abc%'
   </td>
   <td>Finds any values that have "abc" in any position
   </td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>LIKE 's%a'
   </td>
   <td>Finds any values that start with "s" and ends with "a"
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



## **Aggregation**


### **Count:**

c) select count(std_no) from student;

or

select count(*) from student;


### **Min:**

a)select min(cgpa) from student;


### **Max:**

b)select max(grad_date) from student;

i) select max(cgpa) from student where year(grad_date) >= 2004;

0) select name, dept, cgpa from student where dept = "CSE" && cgpa > (select max(cgpa) from student where dept = "EEE"); 


### **Group By:**

d)select max(cgpa), min(cgpa), dept from student group by dept;

e)select max(grad_date), min(grad_date), dept from student group by dept;

f)select dept, count(std_no) from student group by dept;

g)select dept, max(cgpa), min(cgpa) from student group by dept having count(std_no) >= 3;

h) select dept, max(cgpa), min(cgpa), grad_date from student where year(grad_date) >= 2004 group by dept;


### **Having: **

//Having is used to check info of any aggregation operation and specially after group by

-> select max(cgpa), min(cgpa), dept from student group by dept having count(*) >= 2; 


### **Proper SQL Query: SFWGH**

**S**elect * **F**rom student **W**here id = xx and name in(select name from student where dept = xx) **G**roup by dept **H**aving count(id) >= 1;




## **Subquery:**

a) select name from student where cgpa= (select max(cgpa) from student);


### **IN:**

b) select name, dept, cgpa from student where (dept, cgpa) **in**(select dept, min(cgpa) from student group by dept);


### **ANY:**

select name, dept, cgpa from student where dept = "CSE" && cgpa > **any**(select cgpa from student where dept = "EEE");


### **ALL:**

select name, dept, cgpa from student where dept = "CSE" && cgpa > **all**(select cgpa from student where dept = "EEE");




## **Join Operation:**


### **Inner Join: joins common**



* select * from customerinfo c, checkinoutinfo cio where c.NID = cio.NID;
* select * from customerinfo c inner join checkinoutinfo cio on where c.NID = cio.NID;
* SELECT NAME AS COURSE_NAME, GRADE AS STUDENT_GRADE FROM GRADE G, COURSE C WHERE G.ID = C.ID AND G.STUDENT_ID = 234; 
* SELECT C.NAME AS COURSE_NAME, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY C.NAME) AS CourseTally FROM TEACHER T, COURSE C WHERE T.ID = C.TEACHER_ID AND T.ID = 3578; 


### **Left Join:  O>&lt;O   => O>**



* select * from customerinfo c left join checkinoutinfo cio on c.NID = cio.NID;


### **Right Join: O>&lt;O   => &lt;O**



* select * from customerinfo c Right join checkinoutinfo cio on c.NID = cio.NID;


### **Full Outer Join: joins all content of tables**



* select * from customerinfo c FULL OUTER JOIN checkinoutinfo cio on c.NID = cio.NID;




## **Quiz 2**


```
For questions involving the formula r = (n%x)+1, you should be aware of the following: 
x will be a given number, which will typically be the total number of rows in a table
n is the last two digits of your ID
r is the row number of the table that you should use
% sign denotes modulus operation
```

Additionally, the following information is given regarding the relations:



* STUDENT: ID (PK)
* GRADE: ID and Student_ID (PK), Student_ID (FK references STUDENTâs ID)
* Teacher: ID (PK)
* Course: ID (PK), Teacher_ID (FK references TEACHERâs ID)

1. For RELATION, r = (n%3)+1, write down the following:



1. SQL statements for **creating **the relation. Ensure that you use sensible data types for the attributes. [3]
2. SQL statements needed to **insert **two new rows of your own, using relevant data from your own imagination. [2]
3. Insert a single **screenshot** showing SQL statements from both a) and b) after they have been executed in a DBMS. If you see an error, **explain** the reasoning behind it. If you do not see an error, explain what couldâve caused one even if there were no syntax errors. [2]

Note that your marks for answers a) and b) are dependent upon you uploading an appropriate screenshot in c). \

1. CREATE TABLE course (

  ID VARCHAR(7) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,

 NAME VARCHAR(25) NULL,

  Teacher_ID INT NULL);



2. INSERT INTO COURSE VALUES ("CSE281", "Java Theory", 2000),

    ("CSE282", "Java Lab", 2001);

3. There is an error because I didn't use the "VALUES" SQL keyword during inserting corresponding columns data.

    ```
For questions 2 and 3 below, you have to write SQL statements to satisfy the given requirements and explain them (the statements) in your own words. Correct statements without valid explanations will not be eligible for any marks.
```



2. Retrieve the course names and course grades obtained by the student with the ID 234.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


SELECT NAME AS COURSE_NAME, GRADE AS STUDENT_GRADE FROM GRADE G, COURSE C WHERE G.ID = C.ID AND G.STUDENT_ID = 234; 

3. Retrieve the number of courses taught by the teacher whose ID is 3578. Your table should have a single column named CourseTally containing the number of courses.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


SELECT C.NAME AS COURSE_NAME, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY C.NAME) AS CourseTally FROM TEACHER T, COURSE C WHERE T.ID = C.TEACHER_ID AND T.ID = 3578; 




## **Worksheet 4**

### **Task 1**

Create a bank database. Then, write SQL statements to create the relations in that database by referring to the schema. Ensure that you use sensible data types for the attributes by referring to both the database schema and state.


### **Task 2**

Populate the database with the data given above.


### **Task 3**



1. Find the names and cities of customers who have a loan at Perryridge branch
